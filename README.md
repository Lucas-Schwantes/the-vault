# The Vault
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lucas-Schwantes/the-vault/master/src/assets/imgs/logo.png)

A simple app to save the movies you`ve watched, and intend to watch!

This app was (and is being) developed with Ionic, using the OMDb API (http://www.omdbapi.com/)

- You can save Movies or TV Series in a list of watched or not-watched.
- You can see more info about any Movie or TV Series availabre in the OMDB API.
- Theres a randomizer, which picks randomly one of your not-watched movies.

But there`s much more to be done
